**What I accomplished**
- Computed MSQ RPE for CSC representation
- From this, plotted cue loss for each trial
- Compared this plot with RNN loss per cue per trial, for cue for cue


**Tasks to accomplish**

- Move to valueRNN repo
- Normalize all plots (same domain range)
- Plot cue 5 vs cue 3 for RNN (plot for 5 models), CSC
- Plot cue 6 vs cue 4 for RNN (plot for 5 models -- do as a last thing), CSC
- Train on dataloader 1, freeze weights, train on dataloader 2

- Think about other models
	- Stack CSC representations, project to a shared representation state in lower dimension 
	- And think about what insights they say (i.e learning cue 1 before and after block 1)
