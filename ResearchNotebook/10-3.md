What I did before:
- Desinged TD learning module and plotting module
- Designed expreiment to mimick Nao's experiment
- Plotted Vt(cue on set)

New cues reward times out of dist
Have them be intermediate

See if there is a correlation between cue delay and learning rate

If we do by gamma - the distance that the blue has to travel is longer than red, so we need to normalize
The time step we achieve the ground truth gamma for Z(t) 0 (within 0.95 of truth)

ITI complication -- but our CSC also doesn't value ITI

- Visualize cue loss better
- Loss is np.MSE of `loss += loss_fn(V_hat[:,i][:l], V_target[:,i][:l])` 
- In the CSC, if you compute the RPE the time step, square that, and average it witihin each trial (average squared RPE per trial)
- MSE from RNN is msq RPE
