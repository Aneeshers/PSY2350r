Plot is wrong - but algorithm is right

This one is right though

Interesting Experiment (accelerated learning experiment):

Tasks to do:
- Fix true vs estimate plot
- Plot the Vt(onset of cue) for each cue over time, we should get a graph like the following:

- Pick 0.99 as gamma for this, to make sure that our weight value isn't already decayed at cue onset
- Look into RNN code -- we want to set epochs to 1, to only look at the trials once (you can train by just having more trials)
- Look into dataloader to see if its random sampling or not
