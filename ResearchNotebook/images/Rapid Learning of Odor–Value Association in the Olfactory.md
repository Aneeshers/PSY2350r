**Objective of the Task:**
The primary goal of the odor-reward categorization task is to understand how mice can quickly and flexibly learn new associations between specific odors and their corresponding rewards within a single session.

**Basic Structure of the Task:**
1. **Odor Presentation:** Mice are exposed to various odors. Each odor has a specific association, either with a reward or without a reward.
2. **Learning Phase:** Mice are trained to recognize which odors are associated with rewards. Over time, they learn to categorize odors based on whether they will receive a reward or not upon detecting that odor.
3. **Response:** After smelling the odor, the mice have to make a decision, typically a motor action like licking, based on whether they expect a reward or not.

**Key Features:**
1. **Flexibility:** The task is designed such that mice can acquire new odor-reward associations within a single session. This means that they can quickly adapt to new information and modify their behavior accordingly.
2. **Neural Recording:** While the mice are performing the task, the researchers record neural activity. This allows them to study how the brain processes and represents the odor-reward associations in real-time.
3. **Rapid Acquisition:** One of the significant findings from the task is that the olfactory tubercle (OT) in the mice's brains rapidly acquires a representation of the reward category associated with the odor. This acquisition happens within minutes, and the information is expressed within 100 ms of the mice sampling the odor, which is well before they make any motor action in response.

**Significance:**
The development of this task is crucial because it provides a controlled environment to study the neural mechanisms underlying odor-reward learning. By understanding how the brain processes and represents these associations, researchers can gain insights into the broader principles of sensory processing, learning, and decision-making.

In summary, the novel odor categorization task is a behavioral paradigm that allows researchers to study how mice learn and represent associations between specific odors and rewards. The rapid and flexible nature of this learning provides valuable insights into the neural mechanisms underlying sensory-driven reward behaviors.


**Objective:**
The researchers aimed to understand how the brain encodes odor identity and its associated reward value, focusing on two regions: the posterior piriform cortex (pPC) and the olfactory tubercle (OT).

**Methods:**
- Mice were trained on an odor-reward categorization task where they could learn new odor-reward associations within a single session.
- Neural activity was recorded in the pPC and OT while the mice performed the task.

**Key Findings:**
1. **Identity Coding:**
   - Previous research has primarily focused on how the piriform cortex (PC) encodes odor identity.
   - In this study, the researchers found that the pPC primarily reflects sensory coding with minimal information about reward categories.
   - Individual OT neurons, however, carry information about both odor identity and reward category, allowing for rapid and flexible learning of reward-oriented behavior.

2. **Reward Coding:**
   - The OT carries an explicit representation of reward category, which can be detected rapidly (within 100 ms of odor sampling) and well before the motor action (like licking).
   - As mice learn new odor-reward associations, OT neurons adjust their firing properties to code for the reward category during the same session.
   - The pPC, on the other hand, showed little evidence of explicit reward category representation.

3. **Rapid Learning in OT:**
   - The OT's ability to rapidly acquire reward-selective responses is similar to the dorsal striatum's response in monkeys during visual stimulus-reward association tasks.
   - The OT's rapid response might support decision-making during learning. The strength of olfactory synaptic inputs to the ventral striatum can be modulated by dopamine release, suggesting that dopamine might play a role in reinforcing odor responses in the OT.

4. **Potential Mechanism for Rapid Learning:**
   - The researchers suggest that rapid learning of reward selectivity might involve olfactory bulb (OB) or PC inputs evoking odor responses in the OT, which are then reinforced by dopamine release from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) projections to the OT upon reward delivery.

5. **Comparison with Other Studies:**
   - Another study by Gadziola et al. (2019) corroborated the findings of this research, emphasizing the OT's central role in odor-driven reward-motivated behaviors.

**Conclusion:**
The study provides insights into how the olfactory system processes and represents behaviorally relevant information, such as rewards. The OT plays a central role in encoding reward information, making it a key region for understanding rapid sensorimotor reinforcement in the context of olfactory cues.

**Learning of Novel Odorâ€“Reward Associations:**

This section describes a study where mice were trained to associate specific odors with rewards. The goal was to understand how mice learn new odor-reward associations and how their behavior and neural responses change over time.

**A. Training and Introduction of Novel Odors:**
1. **Initial Phase:** Mice were trained using a set of eight odors. During this phase, the set of odors remained consistent.
2. **Introduction of Novel Odors:** After 5-10 training sessions, half of the original odors (two that were associated with rewards and two that were not) were replaced with new odors, termed as "Novel."
3. **Measurement Phase:** Before introducing another new set of odors, the researchers kept the current set of odors constant for at least one more session. This allowed them to measure the mice's behavioral and neural responses to the newly introduced odors.
4. **Odor Representation:** Different shapes in the study's diagrams represent different sets of odors. If odors have the same shape, they were introduced to the mice at the same time. Hollow shapes represent new odors that the mice hadn't encountered in previous sessions, while filled shapes represent familiar odors that the mice had learned about in earlier sessions. Red shapes signify odors that come with a reward, and black shapes represent odors without a reward.

**B. Performance Measurement:**
1. The researchers tracked the mice's performance in recognizing the four new odors over the first three days of learning.
2. The graph shows the average performance for all the new odors based on the number of times they were presented. Each new odor was shown approximately 35 times in each session.

**C & D. Behavioral Responses to Novel Odors:**
1. These sections depict the mice's Go/No-Go behavioral responses to the new odors during the first session.
2. The color code is as follows: Red indicates that the mouse licked (expecting a reward), and black indicates that the mouse did not lick.
3. Each row in the diagram represents one new odor. The length of each row corresponds to the total number of times that specific odor was presented during its first introduction.
