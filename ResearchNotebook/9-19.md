make observations and Z representations modular
Multiple ques -- trial A, then trial B, then trial C -- different cues concatenated
-- you can also try shared representation for Z (the value function of the different cues should converge to the average of them separately )
-- avg squared RPE
- imagine t=3, and t=4, with one odor,
